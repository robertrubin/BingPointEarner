An Historically Black College and University marching band (also known as an HBCU band) is the marching band sponsored by an Historically Black College and University. A distinctive "HBCU-style" of marching band originated in the American South in the 1940s through the blending of earlier traditions of military music and minstrel shows with a performance repertoire based on popular song.

The spectator popularity of HBCU bands within the campus communities of their institutions has historically eclipsed that of traditional athletics. One 2009 survey of students and alumni of HBCUs found that more than 83-percent felt that most people attended HBCU football games only to see the marching band perform.

Different studies have linked HBCU membership with both higher and lower rates of academic achievement versus the at-large student population. Among the predominantly male, African-American membership of the ensembles, they have been theorized to support positive identity formation. Instances of death and serious injury have occurred among HBCU band members due to patterns of endemic and often violent hazing.
